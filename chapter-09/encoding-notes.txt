According to the book, you can convert or "encode" video and audio files using websites like mirovideoconverter.com for videos, and platforms like SoundCloud or Myspace for audio.
However, from my experience, using FFmpeg is much easier and far more flexible.

🔧 How to Install FFmpeg:
You can install FFmpeg depending on your operating system:

-> Windows:
Run pip install ffmpeg-python or download it from ffmpeg.org

-> macOS:
Use Homebrew:
brew install ffmpeg

-> Linux (Debian/Ubuntu):
sudo apt install ffmpeg

▶️ How to Use FFmpeg:
1- Open your terminal, command prompt, or bash.

2- Navigate to the folder containing your media file.

3- Run the following command to convert a file:

Syntax:
-> ffmpeg -i input.mp4 output.avi
**notes**:
Replace input.mp4 with your video or audio file.
Replace output.avi with your desired output format (e.g., .mp3, .wav, .mov, etc.).

FFmpeg supports a wide range of formats and is highly customizable, making it a powerful tool for media conversion beyond what online tools offer.
