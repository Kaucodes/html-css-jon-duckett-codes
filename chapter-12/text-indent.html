    <p class="intro">
      The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Briard">briard</a>, or berger
      de brie, is a large breed of dog traditionally used as a herder and
      guardian of sheep.

    <h2>Breed History</h2>
    <p>
      The briard, which is believed to have originated in France, has been bred
      for centuries to herd and to protect sheep. The breed was used by the
      French Army as sentries, messengers and to search for wounded soldiers
      because of its fine sense of hearing. Briards were used in the First World
      War almost to the point of extinction. Currently the population of briards
      is slowly recovering. Charlemagne, Napoleon, Thomas Jefferson and
      Lafayette all owned briards.
